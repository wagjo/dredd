# dredd

Simple Online Automated Judge System in Clojure. Mainly used in my Programming course so many things in it are ad-hoc. Moreover, many texts are not in english language, as it is not used in english speaking country.

## Usage

* Copy dredd.local_settings_example.clj into dredd.local_settings.clj and customize it

* Starting dredd:
    * screen ./start.sh
    * then press C-a d

* Shutdown:
    * resume with screen -r
    * then C-c to shutdown server
